# Optimal reference tracking
This repository contains the Matlab code for generating the optimal discrete-time references to optimally follow a given trajectory.

This code is related to the following publication

E. Bini, A. V. Papadopoulos, J. Higgins, N. Bezzo, "Optimal Reference Tracking for Sampled-Data Control Systems", Proceedings of the 61st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), 2022.

## Quick and dirty start
Just
1. open Matlab,
2. launch `main_first_full_script.m` and
3. read it, understand it, modify it as in usual Matlab style :-)
